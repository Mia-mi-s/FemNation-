            <h2>So, What's Feminism? </h2>
            <div class="DefinitionBox">
                <p class="MainDefinition">
                    Feminism is simply the idea that everyone, no matter their gender, should get the same rights and chances. Its as simple as that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's about stopping nonesensed rules and stereotypes that tell people what they can or can't do just because of their gender.
                </p>
            </div>

                    <h3>Equality, Not Bossing Around</h3>
                    <p>Feminism isn't about girls taking over or guys being kicked out.
                       It's about balance and making sure everyone gets a fair shot at basics such as school, jobs, and life.</p>

                <div class="Point">
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-person-circle-check icon"></i> 
                    <h3>Breaking Limits</h3>
                    <p>It's also about fighting dumb rules and stereotypes that stop anyone from doing what they wanna do.
                       This isn't just for women, it's for everyone who gets held back by gender ideologies.</p>

                    <h3>Choice & Respect</h3>
                    <p>The main thing is choice.
                       Everyone should get to decide their own life without getting judged for their gender.</p>

                <p>Feminism tries to fix a bunch of unfair stuff:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Economics: Make sure boys and girls get paid the same and have the same chances at jobs.</li>
                    <li>Reproductive Rights: People should have control over their own bodies and health care.</li>
                    <li>Stop Violence: No one should get hurt just because of their gender.</li>
                    <li>Politics: Everyone should have a say and be represented fairly.</li>
                    <li>Break Stereotypes: Stop the dumb ideas about what boys or girls “should” do.</li>

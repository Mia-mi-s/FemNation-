                        <p>
                           Focused on rights denied and voices silenced the right to vote, the right to own, the right to be seen.
                            Women stood in the long shadow of law,where power was written without their names.
                            Susan B. Anthony spoke when silence was safer.
                            Emmeline Pankhurst marched where punishment waited.
                            They paid for progress with years, with pain, with breath,
                            carrying justice forward while knowing
                            they might never live to touch it.
                            What they won was not freedom complete,
                            but a door unlatched
                            left open for the future to push wider.

                    <div class="description-box">
                        <p>
                            During the second wave of feminism, the movement centered on social and workplace equality,
                             revealing how unequal pay, restricted reproductive rights, and gender-based violence shaped everyday life.
                              The phrase “the personal is political” carried lasting weight, reminding society that private struggles were deeply tied to public systems of power.

                        <p>
                            In the third wave of feminism, the movement challenged the idea of a single feminist experience, embracing diversity, individuality, and intersectionality.
                            It recognized that gender could not be separated from race, sexuality, culture, or identity, and that equality must account for all of them.

                        <p>
                            The fourth wave of feminism is driven by digital activism and social media, using global platforms to challenge sexism, harassment, and inequality.
                            Movements such as #MeToo and #TimesUp show modern feminism in action, building on earlier struggles and proving that the movement continues to grow, adapt, and respond to the world it faces.

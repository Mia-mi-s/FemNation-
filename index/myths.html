            <h1>Myths & Misconceptions About Feminism</h1>
            <p class="text">
                Feminism is one of the most influential social movements in the world — and also one of the most misunderstood. Across countries, media portrayals and cultural stereotypes have often distorted what feminism truly means. Some people still believe it's about anger or division, but feminism simply stands for <strong>gender equality</strong> — equal rights, opportunities, and respect for everyone, regardless of gender. These myths persist because of outdated beliefs, online misinformation, and resistance to social change. <strong>Correcting them matters.</strong> When we understand feminism based on facts rather than fear, we can engage in honest conversations about equality and progress.

                <h3>Myth #1: Feminists hate men</h3>
                <p>Truth: Feminism fights <strong>sexism</strong>, not men. Many men actively support feminism and benefit from breaking free of restrictive gender expectations.</p>

                <h3>Myth #2: Feminism isn't needed anymore</h3>
                <p>Truth: Equality is not yet achieved. Women remain underrepresented in leadership roles, earn less than men, and face gender-based violence. Feminism addresses these issues and more.</p>

                <h3>Myth #3: Feminism is only for women</h3>
                <p>Truth: Feminism benefits everyone. Men, women, and non-binary people can all experience positive change from equality, including more freedom to express themselves and participate fully in society.</p>

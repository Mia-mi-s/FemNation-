                    <p class="IntroText">
                        Feminism is one of the most influential social movements in the world — and also one of the most misunderstood. Across countries, media portrayals and cultural stereotypes have often distorted what feminism truly means. Some people still believe it's about anger or division, but feminism simply stands for **gender equality** — equal rights, opportunities, and respect for everyone, regardless of gender. These myths persist because of outdated beliefs, online misinformation, and resistance to social change. **Correcting them matters.** When we understand feminism based on facts rather than fear, we can engage in honest conversations about equality and progress.

                        <h3>The Truth: Feminism fights **sexism**, not men.</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is one of the most common and damaging misconceptions about feminism. Feminism is not about hating men — it's about opposing sexism and inequality in all forms. In fact, many men proudly identify as feminists and actively work toward gender equality. The feminist movement also challenges the restrictive expectations placed on men — often called **toxic masculinity** — which pressure men to hide emotions or avoid vulnerability. By promoting empathy and emotional freedom, feminism helps men too.

                        <h3>The Truth: **Equality is not yet achieved.**</h3>
                        <p>
                            Some argue that because women can vote, work, and go to school, feminism's mission is complete. But while progress is undeniable, equality is still far from achieved — globally and locally. Women remain **underrepresented in leadership roles**, earn less on average than men, and face gender-based violence in both public and private life. Around the world, access to education, healthcare, and bodily autonomy remains unequal. Today's feminism has evolved to address a wider range of issues — including LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive freedom, and intersectionality — ensuring no one is left behind.
